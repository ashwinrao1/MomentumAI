## Introduction

MomentumML is a real-time analytics platform that quantifies and visualizes team momentum throughout basketball games. The system uses live NBA data to compute a dynamic Team Momentum Index (TMI) based on possession-level statistics, player events, and game context. The primary goal is to track and predict "runs" in real time, revealing when teams gain or lose control of the game and identifying the factors that drive those shifts.

## Glossary

- **MomentumML System**: The complete real-time basketball analytics platform
- **Team Momentum Index (TMI)**: A composite metric reflecting team control over the last N possessions
- **NBA API**: The nba_api package used as the data source for live game information
- **Possession**: A sequence of events by one team ending with a made shot, turnover, or quarter end
- **Dashboard**: The web-based user interface displaying momentum visualizations
- **Momentum Engine**: The core computation module that calculates TMI and predictions
- **Live Feed**: Real-time data stream from NBA games updated every 20-30 seconds

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a basketball analyst, I want to view real-time team momentum data during live NBA games, so that I can understand which team is controlling the game flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a live NBA game is in progress, THE MomentumML System SHALL poll the NBA API every 20-30 seconds for new play-by-play events
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL compute the Team Momentum Index within 5 seconds of receiving new game data
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL display the current TMI values for both teams on the Dashboard
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL update the momentum visualization automatically without user intervention
5. WHERE a game is selected, THE MomentumML System SHALL maintain continuous data collection throughout the game duration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a basketball fan, I want to see what factors are driving momentum changes, so that I can understand why one team is gaining or losing control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MomentumML System SHALL calculate possession-level features including field goal percentage, turnovers, rebounds differential, pace, and fouls
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL display feature importance rankings showing which factors most influence current momentum
3. WHEN momentum changes occur, THE MomentumML System SHALL highlight the primary contributing factors in the Dashboard
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL provide hover tooltips explaining each momentum driver metric
5. THE MomentumML System SHALL standardize all features using z-scores for consistent comparison

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sports bettor, I want to predict when momentum might shift, so that I can make informed decisions about game outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MomentumML System SHALL train a machine learning model using historical play-by-play data from at least 200 games
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL predict the probability that current team momentum will continue in the next possession
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL provide prediction confidence scores with each momentum forecast
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL update predictions in real-time as new game events occur
5. THE MomentumML System SHALL achieve at least 60% accuracy in momentum direction predictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a basketball coach, I want to visualize momentum trends over time, so that I can identify patterns and make strategic adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MomentumML System SHALL display a line chart showing TMI values plotted against game time
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL use distinct colors and visual indicators for each team's momentum curve
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL allow users to adjust the rolling window size for momentum calculations
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL provide a live scoreboard showing current game state and time remaining
5. THE MomentumML System SHALL maintain momentum history for the entire game duration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different NBA games to analyze, so that I can track momentum across multiple games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MomentumML System SHALL provide a game selection interface listing available live and recent NBA games
2. WHEN a user selects a different game, THE MomentumML System SHALL switch data collection and visualization to the new game within 10 seconds
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL maintain separate momentum calculations for each game session
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL display game metadata including team names, current score, and game status
5. THE MomentumML System SHALL handle multiple concurrent game selections without performance degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle data collection failures gracefully, so that the application remains stable during network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the NBA API becomes unavailable, THEN THE MomentumML System SHALL display an appropriate error message to users
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API requests
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL cache the last known game state to maintain functionality during brief outages
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL log all data collection errors for debugging purposes
5. WHEN API connectivity is restored, THE MomentumML System SHALL resume normal data collection automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and performant, so that I can analyze momentum data without delays or interface issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MomentumML System SHALL render dashboard updates within 2 seconds of receiving new data
2. THE MomentumML System SHALL support concurrent access by at least 50 users without performance degradation
3. THE MomentumML System SHALL optimize database queries to complete within 1 second
4. THE MomentumML System SHALL implement WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming
5. THE MomentumML System SHALL provide loading indicators during data processing operations
